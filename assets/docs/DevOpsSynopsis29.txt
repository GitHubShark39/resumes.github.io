Have work a year with Apache MQ for the messaging service, and just supporting the setup and installation. 

My growth-oriented career experience in DevOps SCM/Agile/CI/CD/CT/CM with a specific focus on cloud, vagrant,
hyper-v, virtualbox, virtualization, availability, and enforcement of complex trouble resolution, NFS trouble resolution, system capacity planning 
and management, development and maintenance of administrative tools, OS level troubleshooting, and resolution of

sand box, to assisting with branching, tagging, merging, and rebasing strategies. Also setting up or creating 
repositories for different projects and cloning projects for the environments that I am supporting. 
Lastly migrating from different repository versions, to move to another server or update the versions.

Could you briefly describe your experience with Kubernetes
Questionnaire from Hitachi Data Systems:

Answers:
 
1. Describe for us in two to three paragraphs the project, the application, and the specific work they performed 
for containerization specifically using Kubernetes.
 
For as working with Kubernetes containerization, I have only worked with administration pieces of Kubernetes,
Where I install the prerequisites of docker, certificates, update my installer. Next working with Docker engine,
daemon, machine, where I have to setup the Kubernetes Master Machine. Also configuration on Kubernetes Master,
where I had to do the following:
Configure kube-apiserver
Configure the kube Controller Manager
Kubernetes Node Configuration
Kubernetes node will run two services the kubelet and the kube-proxy. 
Kubernetes (Docker) images are the key building blocks of Containerized Infrastructure.

Lastly, defined Tesing_for_Image_pull,, setup a neo4j-server, setup a Docker image, Defining imagePullPolicy,
Creating a Containerization Job, and schedule a Containerization Job.

 
2. Describe for us in two to three paragraphs the project, the application, and the specific work they performed 
for networking and specifying the gear and software deployed and used for the development and implementation.

Next Generation Continuous Delivery
There is a transformation happening in IT and it is made up of three waves of innovation: 
infrastructure, application architectures and process/methodologies. 
Lightweight Docker containers, microservices-based application architectures and continuous delivery are simultaneously feeding on each other and 
giving IT the ability to provide more value faster to the business, consumer and user.

To enable you to optimize speed to market with these new technology innovations, the Jenkins® community in collaboration with CloudBees, 
the hub of enterprise Jenkins and DevOps, has released six Docker-related plugins to enable continuous delivery of containerized applications with Jenkins.

The specific plugins announced by the Jenkins project include the following:

Could you briefly describe your experience with Docker? *

Maintaing Docker Containers, Scripts, Images, and Files, also deploying to a Docker Repo for the Docker Production.
Working with databases and Oracle DBs on multiple projects, such as CSC and others.

Own my last project, we had Docker integrated with Jenkins, where the Docker plugin,
and the Artifactory packaging manager plugin was the containerization for deploying
to an AWS Ansible playbook environment, where the support for Jenkins Pipeline to build and continuous delivery 
pipelines for containerized applications using Jenkins and Docker. 

Also providing building projects from a Dockerfile and push to a production gold image to Docker Hub repo. 
Which contain and trigger jobs being tagged within the container and being pushed to Docker Hub repo. 

Implementing tracebility by pushing a particular container which is running in production and 
and can be trace on the Jenkins console output section. 
Using Docker slaves as standardized build containerization shared between Jenkins masters/slaves to 
improve isolation and elasticity. Lastly specifying custom builds for Dev and QA Docker containers.

Docker Services working with:
Docker Workflow 
Build and Publish 
Docker Hub Notification 
Docker Traceability 
Docker Slaves 
Docker Custom Build Environment 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Docker Workflow – provides first-class support for Jenkins Pipeline to build real-world continuous delivery 
pipelines for containerized applications using Jenkins and Docker

Build and Publish – builds projects from a Dockerfile and pushes a tested and proven gold image to Docker Hub

Docker Hub Notification – triggers downstream jobs when a tagged container is pushed to Docker Hub

Docker Traceability – identifies which build pushed a particular container that is running in production and displays that on the Jenkins builds page

Docker Slaves – uses Docker containers as standardized build environments shared between Jenkins masters to improve isolation and elasticity

Docker Custom Build Environment – specifies customized build environments as Docker containers
